# Shadcn Calendar

This is but a simple prototype to both document how to get a react up with vite 
easily, that installs the https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/calendar[Shadcn Calendar] 
and then customizes it in different forms.

## Installation

The steps that were taken in order to get the app and dependencies up and running 
were:

- `pnpm create vite@latest shadcn-calendar` (React > Typescript + SWC)
- `pnpm install`

## Notes

- Used `pnpm`. So installation is with `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run dev`

## Takeaways

<!-- - Shadcn helps getting an already working component to stylize to one's liking pretty easily.
- To extend functionality we do have to extend the base component
- The calendar can be resized however we see fit, and that's nice. -->
